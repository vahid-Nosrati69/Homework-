          Mehran Modiri (Persian: born 7 April 1967) is an Iranian film
          director, film producer, actor, and singer. He is considered to be the
          leading artist in social satire in Iran. His various series, which
          have been broadcast through IRIB have set records in terms of
          viewership (an estimated 85% viewership when he is on-air), as well as
          make him a popular personality among the masses. His artistic career
          began in his teenage years acting in local plays. He then entered the
          world of radio and television in the early 1990s, actively writing
          scripts for and participating in various comedy skits during the
          annual Norooz comedy television shows broadcast by the IRIB. He
          achieved real stardom with his creation of Pavarchin (Tiptoeing), in
          which he won numerous awards for directing and starring in the
          picture. He tasted success again when he directed and starred in
          Noghtechin (Ellipsis), and Jayezeye Bozorg (The Grand Prize), which
          became major hits on television in Iran[citation needed]. Later, he
          followed Pavarchin's storyline with the making of Shabhaye Barareh
          which became his most popular television program yet; the show
          remained incomplete after it was criticized for offending rural
          people. This resulted in an abrupt end to the show after 92 episodes
          without completely explaining the Barareh history. He starred in two
          full-length films and had planned on entering the film industry once
          again after Shabhaye Barareh was completed. However, he instead
          produced and released his next project, the television series Baghe
          Mozaffar. Also, his shows have been popular among the Iranians because
          of expressing the problems of the society in the form of comedy, as he
          believes this genre has the most effectiveness on people.
